### Version 0.1.3

Published to npm! Also, renamed the project from playertwo to tenna. As in (an)tenna.

The preferred method of using tenna for now is

```
npm install -g tenna
tenna path/to/video(optional)
```

- [0c209aa](https://github.com/Dudemullet/tenna/commit/0c209aa8cefafcdbc8077017ea8baa26f0481655) removes references to name player two, add consistent nav bar, changes name from playertwo to tenna

### Version 0.1.2

Kinda major ui changes with this release. We have made it so that theres is (apparently) a single video element in the page. Clicking on the 'play' icon for a video tile will actually toggle visibility between the different video elements and start playing on the clicked videos element.

#### Why not a single `<video>` element ?
  This did not work in some devices, specifically the PS Vita.
